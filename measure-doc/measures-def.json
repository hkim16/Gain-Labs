The most recent estimate appeared this year but reflects data of 2005.  Although work on similar measures continues and is accelerating under the 'green accounting' umbrella, it is not certain that another comparable update will occur. (ii) With only 148 countries, this is one of the vulnerability measures with the weakest coverage. (iii) This measure includes GDP in its calculation as the natural capital is expressed as the net present value of the particular capital as a percentage of the GDP – something we have tried to avoid given it can impose a double jeopardy on poor countries.  However, its correlation with ln(GDP per capita) is R2=0.54 with a wide scatter among the poorer countries (Fig. 6) showing that it provides additional information.",

The methods of calculation are becoming more standardized and it is gradually being taken into account in policy making and national reporting.  Here we use the data provided by the Global Footprint Network led by one of the originators of the idea, Mark Wakernagel. (ii) We also exclude the carbon footprint component of the Ecological Footprint since this does not directly affect sensitivity relating to adaptation.  The urban component is also effectively excluded as it appears in both the demand and supply side of the equation. (ii)  There is a similarity in concepts between the Ecological Footprint and the Natural Accounting approach used in ENC.  We have checked the correlations between the two measures and the data that goes into constructing them.  While there is a strong correlation between some of the components (e.g. Grazing land capital and footprint) as they are based on the same or similar data (Ha of grassland per capita), there is little correlation between the two measures used (r2 is -0.024 and Fig 5) as ultimately the data are used to calculate quite different measures – a measure of capital in one case and a measure of supply in the other.

We sought to include 'environmental treaties' in their broadest sense while avoiding any to do with military/warfare; gross marine pollution, safety at sea and other shipping controls.  We also excluded treaties directly setting up International organizations such as the World Bank etc.  We also excluded agreements with less than 20 signatories. (ii) Some agreements have a limited regional scope (e.g. dealing with Atlantic tuna).  We could have excluded them, but this would have limited the list (16 out of 54 have clear regional scope of application), but many are signed by countries beyond the region (e.g those with fishing fleets in the Atlantic).  Many (17 out of 54) also deal with the agreements on oceans and this may disadvantage land-locked countries, however, land-locked countries are sometimes signatories to such conventions (e.g. those relating to whaling).  It could similarly be argued that some agreements are not relevant to many countries on other grounds (e.g. those to do with desertification).  Thus we chose to retain a wide set of agreements rather than begin a culling process that would have reduced the list to only 10 to 20 or so.",

Internally generated rapid economic and population growth in cities is a challenge in its own right, but it is often exacerbated by substantial migration from rural areas driven as much by the poverty of rural regions as by the attractiveness and opportunities of the cities.  In selecting the measures and in seeking feedback from our technical advisors, we decided to modify our approach to recognize the ‘Human Habitat’ as a 5th life support sector. \n The measures selected do place more direct emphasis on urban habitats than rural.  However, many rural challenges are already covered in the other life support sectors and increasingly the challenge of the future will be creating sustainable cities in a changing world. Cities are usually the financial, administrative and intellectual hubs of society so disruption to their smooth running has significant flow on effects to the rest of the country."
