#GAIN Index, in python

I am porting the Gain Index, curerntly in VBA, into Python using pandas package.

Work in progress, but feel free to pitch in.


##Why VBA

* We started in VBA because of the in-experience of some of us that allowed us to move fast.
* Also because it seems the *de-facto* standard for reserach in economics

##Why move away from VBA

* Many reasons, but mostly for getting rid  of its many quirks and
  performance issues.
* Also testing new approaches to allow better work with the Index in the
  future.

##Why Python

* Plain text coding in separate makes easier to develop and collaborate
* Great potantieal for test, visualizations, and mining of the results.
